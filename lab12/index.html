      <h1>Advanced Logisim Features</h1>
      <p> Here are two more logisim features you will find useful. After reading about tunnels and extenders, begin the lab exercises below.
      </p> 
           
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Tunnels</h2>
        <p>A <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/docs/2.6.0/en/libs/base/tunnel.html">tunnel</a> allows you draw an "invisible wire" to bind two
          points together. Tunnels are grouped by case-sensitive
          labels give to a wire.  They are used to connect wires
          like so:</p>
        <img src="tunnels1.png">
        <p>Which has an effect such as the following:</p>
        <img src="tunnels2.png">
        <p>Some care should be taken as to which wires are connected with tunnels to 
          which other wires, such as in this case:</p>
        <img src="tunnels3.png">
        <p>Which in turn has the following effect:</p>
        <img src="tunnels4.png">

	<p>We <em>strongly</em> recommend you use tunnels with Logisim, because they make your circuits much cleaner looking, and therefore easier to debug.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Extenders</h2>
        <p>When changing the width of a wire, you should use a <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/docs/2.6.0/en/libs/base/extender.html">bit extender</a> for clarity. 
          For example, consider the following implementation of extending an 8-bit wire 
          into a 16-bit wire:</p>
        <img src="extend1.png">
        <p>Whereas the following is much simpler, easier to read, and less error-prone:</p>
        <img src="extend2.png">
        <p>Additionally consider the case of throwing out bits. In this example, an 8-bit 
          wire is being converted into a 16-bit wire by throwing out the other bits:</p>
        <img src="extend3.png">
        <p>Despite the implications of its name, a bit extender can also do this same 
          operation:</p>

      <h1>Lab Exercises</h1>

      <p>Copy the starter lab files as usual, from the directory: <tt>~cs61c/labs/12</tt></p>     
      
      <h2>Exercise 1: Logisim ALU</h2>
      
      <p>In this exercise, you will first implement a 32 bit ALU in
      logisim.

	As a reminder, recall that ALU stands for <em>Arithmetic Logic Unit</em>. An
	ALU is a fundamental building block of a CPU (central
	processing unit) and it performs integer arithmetic and
	logical (bitwise) operations. The function that the ALU
	performs (e.g. add, xor) is determined by the control of our
	datapath, which is determined by the instruction the processor
	is executing. The ALU is highlighted in a simplified datapath diagram below:      </p>

	<img src="alu.png" style="height:150px;width:auto">
	
      <p> This lab assignment is similar to the CPU design project (it
        is essentially a slightly simpler version of Project 4's ALU).
        Hopefully by getting a headstart here in lab, Project 4 will
        go a bit more smoothly!</p>
        
      <div class="section" id="functions">
        <p>The 8 functions that you will implement are: shift left logical, shift right 
        logical, shift right arithmetic, rotate left, rotate right, and, or, and xor. The
        ALU will perform a desired function on 2 32-bit inputs and output the result. The 
        selected function will be determined by the value of the control signal, as 
        listed below.</p>
        
        <p>Here's what occurs for each operation:</p>
        
        <table border="1">
          <thead valign="bottom">
            <tr>
              <th>Control</th>
              <th>Operation</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>

          <tbody valign="top">
            <tr>

        <h4>Checkoff</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Set two inputs to your ALU. Toggle the control bits to
          change the function being performed on the output and verify
          with your TA that the output is correct.</li>

        <h2>Exercise 2: Register File</h2>
        <p>
	  Recall that a register file is an array of registers in a
	CPU. We use the register file to read or write from chosen
	  registers. The regfile is highlighted in a simplified datapath diagram below:</p>
	<img src="regfile.png" style="height:150px;width:auto">
        <p>
	  This exercise will help you understand how a register
	file works, and give you more practice with Logisim. For your project 4 processor,
	  you will be given a register file circuit to use.</p>

	<p>Your regfile will contain 4 registers. Just like in our MIPS processor, we require register 0 to always equal 0.</p>

	<p> The inputs of your circuit are:
	  <ul>
	    <li><tt>RS</tt> - the "source register" to read from</li>
	    <li><tt>RT</tt> - the "target register" to read from</li>
	    <li><tt>RD</tt> - the "destination register" to write to</li>
	    <li><tt>RD_WRITE_VALUE</tt> - the value to write into register <tt>RD</tt></li>
	    <li><tt>RD_WRITE_ENABLE</tt> - <tt>RD</tt> is only written with the contents of <tt>RD_WRITE_VALUE</tt> if this input bit is high</li>
	    <li><tt>CLK</tt> - For our regfile, reads are asynchronous where as writes are synchronous.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>The outputs of your regfile should be:
	  <ul>
	    <li><tt>RS_READ_VALUE</tt> - the value read from register <tt>RS</tt></li>
	    <li><tt>RT_READ_VALUE</tt> - the value read from register <tt>RT</tt></li>
	    <li><tt>REG_{0,1,2,3}_VALUE</tt> - These are the current values for
	    all of your registers. A normal regfile wouldn't include
	    this but it helpful for debuging and also to verify the
	    correctness of your circuit.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

        <div class="section">
	  <h4>Hints:</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Be sure to understand the purpose of all of the pins found on a <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/docs/2.6.0/en/libs/mem/register.html">register</a>.</li>
	    <li>When constructing your regfile, you may find a <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/docs/2.6.0/en/libs/plexers/demux.html">demux</a> to be helpful.</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>
	
      <div class="section">
        <h4>Checkoff</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>First set the contents of some registers manually, and show your TA that reading from <tt>RS</tt> and <tt>RT</tt> works.</li>
	  <li>Now set <tt>RD=11</tt> and demonstrate writing a value into register 3. Ensure the value on the <tt>REG_3_VALUE</tt> only changes on the rising edge of the clock, and that no other registers change values.</li>
	  <li>Set <tt>RD=00</tt> and <tt>RD_WRITE_ENABLE=1</tt> and attempt to write a value into register 0. Its value should not change.</li>
        </ul>
